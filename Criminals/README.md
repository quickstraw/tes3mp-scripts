## Criminals

### Version: 1.2
This is a lua script for tes3mp based on [Skvysh's Criminals](https://github.com/Skvysh/TES3MP-Scripts/tree/master/Criminals) script. Unfortunately, it looks like that script has been taken down.
I fixed the script to run correctly and hopefully without bugs. The script has been updated for easy installation.

### Features

##### Wanted meassages when players' bounties certain threshholds.

##### Bounties can be collected from wanted players by killing them.

##### Prefixes are added to wanted players' messages.

### Installation

##### In the server folder:
Copy this script into the scripts/custom/ folder.

##### In customScripts.lua:
Add ````criminals = require("custom/criminals")```` to the top with the other requires.
