Changes from Skvysh's Criminals:
-Added PlayerIDs after the names in bounty messages.
-Added [Notice] to the global claimed bounty message.
-Changed ProcessBountyReward to take 2 PlayerID inputs instead of a Pid and the name of the killer concatenated
with the killer's Pid.
-Fixed crashing due to the custom variable being nil by creating the custom variable right after character creation.
-Changed the custom variable category from Skvysh to Criminals to remove confusion from which script the
variable belongs.
-Added check for custom variable before each update because the server would sometimes crash.
