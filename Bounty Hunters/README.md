## Bounty Hunters

### Version: 0.9
This is a lua script for tes3mp that spawns bounty hunters to attack those with decently high bounties.
I fixed the script to run correctly and hopefully without bugs. The script has been updated for easy installation.

### Features

##### Spawns enemies that somewhat scale to the player's level and bounty.

##### Bounty hunters are given gear based on their class.

##### Gear is not from a leveled list because NPCs should not scale too hard.

### Installation

##### In the server folder:
Copy this script into the scripts/custom/ folder.

##### In customScripts.lua:
Add ````require("custom/bountyHunters")```` to the top with the other requires.
