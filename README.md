# tes3mp-scripts
Some tes3mp lua scripts I have created or adapted from somewhere else. These scripts are for tes3mp version 0.7.0.
They are updated to use the new hook system for easy installation.

## Bounty Board
Adds a command to display a sorted list of active players with a bounty.

## Criminals
This is a modified version of Skvysh's Criminals script. I fixed some bugs so that it should work without failure.

## Bounty Hunters
Spawns bounty hunters on players with a decently high bounty. Bounty hunters' levels somewhat scale with the criminal player's level and bounty. Bounty hunters' gear do not scale.
